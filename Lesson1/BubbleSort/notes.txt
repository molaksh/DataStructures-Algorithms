Bubble Sort notes

Important to remember Bubble sort is not the most efficient way to sort data.
This is especially because Bubble sort has a quadratic time complexity.
 O(n^2)

Also in the code snippet
    for(int i = 0 ; i< rand.length; i++){
      for(int j = 0; j < rand.length-1-i; j++){
        if(rand[j] > rand[j+1]){
          temp = rand[j];
          rand[j] = rand[j+1];
          rand[j+1] = temp;
        }
      }
    }


1. We are using i < rand.length and j < rand.length-1-i since we dont need to traverse to the end of the array since those would have been already filled with the largest value.

2. for the actual sorting, we use temp variable temp and rand[j] and rand[j+1] to do actual sorting. here, rand[j] is the reference and rand[j+1] is the next element of the array.
